## Create your Digital Writing Folio and add Week 1 Swift Reflection 

Create a public repository with a `README` called `digital-writing-folio`.

On the main page of the repository you will see a button called "Add file".

1. Select "Add file"
2. Select "Create new file" from the dropdown that appears
3. At the top where you can see "Name your file..." type in `swift-reflections.md`
4. Scroll down to the bottom and select "Commit new file"
5. Repeat the above steps to add `in-class-exercises.md`

Look at the [example digital writing folio](https://github.com/blidau/digital-writing-folio). This should give you an idea of what the folio should initially look like.

On the example digital writing folio click on the "README.md". You should see a button that looks like "<>" just above the content. Select that button to see the formatting on the page. You can follow this technique for all the pages if you need to see the formatting used. Also read the reference for [basic writing and formatting syntax on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

Edit the -swift-reflections- page you just created jot down a few thoughts on the following questions. 

### Swift Reflection: Your Writing 

- What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?
- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write? How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
- Why do you use these tools (or techniques)? How might disrupting these tools and techniques change the way you write, what you are writing about and how you express it?
